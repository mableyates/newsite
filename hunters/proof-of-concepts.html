    <h3>How do I create a detailed proof of concept?</h3>
    <p>I have a little secret for you that will completely change the way you create your proof of concepts: <b>Stick to the rules like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)">white hat</a> and then, with that in mind, create your proof of concept thinking like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat">black hat</a>.</b> What I mean by this is always stick by the rules while hunting and then when it comes to demonstrating the impact of the issue, create your proof of concept in a way that highlights how your finding could potentially affect the target. This does <b>not</b> always work and definitely does <b>not</b> mean you should start escalating the issue and gaining unauthorised access. This simply signifies that you need to understand what the real potential impact is of your finding and then work according to the program's rules in order to create something really clever which could actually work in a real-world scenario. You can see this mindset in action in <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/289823">this report</a>.</p>

    <h3>Hall of PoC™</h3>
    <p>This is a mega list of proof of concepts (PoCs) for you to use when demonstrating the impact of your issue. The PoCs are designed so that the bug bounty program can quickly understand the issue and to ensure you do not harm any of their users or services in the process. That being said, always follow the rules on the program's policy; the program's security policy always takes precedence over the list.</p>

          <br/><br/>Investigate only with the IDs of your <i>own</i> test accounts &mdash; do not leverage the issue against other users' data &mdash; and describe your full reproduction process in the report.</td>

          After you've confirmed the presence of a CSRF bug &mdash; ensuring there are no leftover token or once-only values &mdash; either attach a file to demonstrate your proof of concept or paste the code in a code block in your report.

   &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Click me&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>
          When designing a real-world example, either hide the form (<code>style="display:none;"</code>) and make it submit automatically, or design it so that it resembles a component from the target's page.
