    <h4><i>"Web Hacking 101"</i> by Peter Yaworski</h4>

    <blockquote>"On December 22, 2015, Twitter paid over $14,000 to ethical hackers for exposing vulnerabilities. This wasn't a shakedown. Sites like Twitter, Shopify, Dropbox, Yahoo, Google, Facebook and more, ask ethical hackers to report security bugs and pay them.

    <h4><i>"Learn Python The Hardway"</i> by Zed A. Shaw</h4>

No experience necessary to begin, and you can even try the book out for free to see if the method works for you.
